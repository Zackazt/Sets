# Sets
Honestly this is just a namespace with tools that I have found handy in playing with numbers.  
So far this has no direct purpose other than simply a set of toys.  It currently looks quite
ugly, but it is a work in progress.  I'm really just trying to get better at OOP, and started
to turn my high-level functions into classes.
